# TREX-RAPID-RESPONSE

Powershell incident investigation tool for PC.

I needed a way to investigate a machine I believed was compromised.  There are quite a few applications that require a client to be installed first on the machine.  

There are a bunch of tools from systeminternals that do an excellent job of providing information.  

I wanted it portable and be able to be ran both locally and remotely.  After all scripts are ran, I wanted to be able to disable the machine from the network.

This does it all.  Starting with the Local Version upload.  Update 02/12/2024 This is now fully functioning.

Remote Version Uploaded 02/12/2024.  

Remote Version Updated 03/11/2025. - For remote functions that require a domain name, the domain name is now retreived from the computer you are currently using so no changing of the file is needed.

Just download the script.  Rename it to a .ps1 file and run as an admin with powershell.
