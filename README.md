Powershell incident investigation tool for PC.

I needed a way to investigate a machine I believed was compromised.  There are quite a few applications that require a client to be installed first on the machine.  
There are a bunch of tools from systeminternals that do an excellent job of providing information.  

I wanted it portable and be able to be ran both locally and remotely.  After all scripts are ran, i wanted to be able to disable the machine from the network.

This does it all.  Starting with the Local Version upload.  Still working on the remote version.

Just download the script.  Rename it to a .ps1 file and run as an admin with powershell.
